## 🔍 Technical Details

### Before: Fragmented Loading
```
User visits → Font loading blocks (1s) → Load 7+ chunks → 
Some fail → Retries → Eventually timeout (30s) → Error
```

### After: Optimized Loading
```
User visits → Page renders immediately → Progress bar shows → 
Load 3 chunks in parallel → React initializes → 
Service worker registers → App ready (1-2s)! ✅
```
