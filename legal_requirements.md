# Ontario Wills and Power of Attorney Legal Requirements

## Wills

### Validity Requirements:
*   **Age:** Testator must be at least 18 years old.
*   **Mental Capacity:** Testator must be mentally capable, understanding their property and the nature of their actions.
*   **In Writing:** The will must be in writing.
*   **Signature:** The testator must sign the will in the presence of two witnesses.
*   **Witnesses:** Two witnesses must be present when the testator signs and must also sign the will in the testator's presence. Witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will.
*   **Holographic Wills:** If entirely handwritten by the testator, no witnesses are needed. It must be dated and state the testator's full name.

### Key Considerations:
*   **Wet Signature:** A physical, 


hand-written signature is required.
*   **Formal vs. Holographic:** Formal wills require witnesses, while holographic wills (entirely handwritten by the testator) do not.
