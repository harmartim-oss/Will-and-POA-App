## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **EnhancedAILegalService**: Main prediction engine
2. **OntarioCaseLawAnalyzer**: Legal precedent analysis
3. **Case Database**: Ontario jurisprudence repository
4. **NLP Processing**: Text analysis and entity extraction

### Prediction Algorithm

1. **Fact Extraction**: Parse and categorize case information
2. **Case Matching**: Find similar cases using weighted similarity scoring
3. **Outcome Analysis**: Analyze historical outcomes and patterns
4. **Prediction Generation**: Calculate probabilities and confidence scores
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Generate strategic advice based on risk analysis

## Confidence Scoring

The system uses a multi-factor confidence calculation:

- **Case Volume**: Number of similar cases found (up to 60% weight)
- **Outcome Clarity**: Distribution certainty (up to 40% weight)  
- **Similarity Strength**: Average similarity scores (up to 20% weight)

Maximum confidence is capped at 95% to acknowledge inherent uncertainty in legal predictions.

## Ontario Legal Database

The system includes precedents from:

- Ontario Superior Court of Justice
- Court of Appeal for Ontario
- Divisional Court decisions
- Administrative tribunal decisions

### Key Legal Principles

- **Banks v. Goodfellow**: Testamentary capacity test
- **Substitute Decisions Act**: POA requirements
- **Succession Law Reform Act**: Will execution standards
- **Fiduciary Duty**: Attorney obligations

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites validate:

- Core prediction algorithms
- API endpoint functionality
- Integration with case law analyzer
- Error handling and edge cases
- Real-world scenario simulation

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Fact Input**: Provide detailed case information for accurate predictions
2. **Professional Judgment**: Use predictions as guidance, not absolute determinants
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep case databases current with latest precedents
4. **Validation**: Cross-reference predictions with human legal expertise

### Limitations

- Predictions based on historical data patterns
- Cannot account for novel legal arguments
- Judicial discretion introduces unpredictability
- Local court practices may vary
- Settlement negotiations involve human factors
